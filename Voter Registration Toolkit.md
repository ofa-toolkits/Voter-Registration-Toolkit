**Voter Registration**** Toolkit**

**Introduction**

Voting is a cornerstone of civic participation in a representative democracy. It is our fundamental right and part of our civic responsibility to raise our voice in shaping the kind of community we want to be. 

In recent decades, voter participation has declined, in part because of voter suppression and intimidation, but also because of an increase in cynicism toward government and a lack of hope that individuals voices can truly make a difference. We know this decrease in participation is more likely to affect students, communities of color, low income urban and rural communities -- the very communities most affected by issues like health care, paid leave, climate change, criminal justice reform, and more. We deserve better.

OFA believes in Fair Democracy for everyone. Civic engagement is a personal responsibility, but it is also a national obligation for our country to ensure full participation and access to our democracy to everyone. Through OFA’s voter registration access and education efforts, volunteers will be trained to help give people an opportunity to register to vote through a partnership with Vote.org. OFA volunteers will use proven, multi-touch methods of engagement and relationship building to ensure people don’t fall through the cracks in the voter registration process. Access to civic participation and education are crucial to shifting power away from donors, lobbyists, and special interests in Washington, DC and back towards bringing about tangible change within our communities.

**Goals **

OFA has launched a nationwide effort to bring voter registration to communities across the country through our partnership with Vote.org. OFA volunteers will be providing their friends and neighbors with the opportunity to register themselves to vote through Vote.org and begin a conversation on the issues that matter to them and their community.

Voting is a foundational step in becoming civically engaged. At OFA, we believe that by helping people access voter registration, we help to unlock people’s power to change their community. We will focus on communities most vulnerable to low voter participation by building relationships and helping people access their own political power.  

**What is Vote.org?**

OFA has partnered with [Vote.org](http://my.ofa.us/verify) to use technology to simplify political engagement and strengthen democracy. Through this tool, people who want to register to vote, can begin the registration process, and in some states, complete their registration online. Once participants submit their information through Vote.org’s portal, OFA will be able to track if participants actually made it onto the voter rolls. If they didn’t, OFA can follow up with them to see what went wrong. 

**Using Vote.org**

**The Follow-up**

Be sure to bookmark OFA’s link: my.ofa.us/verify. Using this link will allow OFA to track who made it onto the voter rolls and who did not. OFA volunteers will then be able to follow up with those who were not able to complete their registration, find out why, and help make sure they have an opportunity to complete the process. If you do not use this link, we will not be able to follow up with anyone whose registration doesn’t go through!

 

**Report Back**

Use our [report back f](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bL38nOkFJ1Zvo2WqWaNcFAb2l4t4YdZE85fLvFPFrMo)[orm](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bL38nOkFJ1Zvo2WqWaNcFAb2l4t4YdZE85fLvFPFrMo) to tell us about your experience with [vote.org](http://my.ofa.us/verify) and what you are hearing while  engaging in conversations about important issues with your neighbors.

If potential voters have questions about the rules in their state or about the form itself, you should not answer those questions directly. Rather, there are several sites with detailed information to help them and you can direct them to these resources: 

* Vote.org has [a comprehensive list](https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-rules/) of state requirements to register to vote. 

* Fair Elections Legal Network has [state specific guides](http://fairelectionsnetwork.com/state-guides/) covering a variety of topics

* The National Voter Registration Day website [also has a state by state guide](https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/partner-toolkit/rules-for-voter-registration-drives/) 

* If they are ever in doubt, be sure to direct them to visit their Secretary of State’s (SOS) website. There are links to each state’s SOS website at the bottom of this document

If you experience problems with OFA’s Vote.org link or have feedback or best practices you would like to share, please email us at [organizing@ofa.us](mailto:organizing@ofa.us) and we’ll connect you with your Regional Organizing Manager. 

Again, you should not provide assistance to potential voters in filling out or submitting their registration forms aside from making the Vote.org platform available.  

If you have a legal question about your state’s voter registration laws, including eligibility or the registration process,, please visit the websites listed above. OFA is not able to provide legal counsel and the laws of each state differ.
